# 💫 About Me:

## 👋🏿 Hi, I'm Cristina John – QA Analyst | Transitioning into Data Analytics | Python • SQL • Excel • Test Automation in Progress


I'm a QA Analyst transitioning into Data Analytics, blending my experience in quality assurance with data-driven tools like Python, SQL, and Excel. My background in QA has trained me to spot inconsistencies, validate large datasets, and prioritize accuracy which are skills that directly translate to effective data analysis. 

From writing test cases to verifying data integrity across complex systems, I've developed a strong analytical mindset that fuels my ability to generate clean, reliable insights. Now, I'm expanding that foundation through hands-on analytics projects that showcase not just what data says but whether it's trustworthy enough to act on.


Technical Skills: 
- QA Testing (Manual + Exploratory)
- Python | SQL | Excel | Jupyter Notebooks
- Selenium | Pytest (QA Automation – in progress)
- Jira | Google Sheets | Data analysis
