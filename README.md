# 💫 About Me:

## 👋🏿 Hi, I'm Cristina John — Data Analyst with a QA Background | Tableau • SQL • Excel

One of the biggest lessons I took from QA is the importance of asking the right questions before diving into the work.

In QA, it’s not effective to start testing a feature without understanding the expected outcome, edge cases, and success criteria. Asking questions upfront helps avoid rework, unclear results, and misaligned expectations later on.

I carry that same mindset into data analysis. Before writing queries or building dashboards, I focus on understanding the business question, what decisions the data is meant to support, and what “success” actually looks like. This allows me to analyze data with intention and deliver insights that are clear, relevant, and actionable.

Technical Skills: 
- QA Testing (Manual + Exploratory)
- Python | SQL | Excel | Tableau
- Selenium | Pytest (QA Automation – in progress)
- Jira | Google Sheets | Data analysis
